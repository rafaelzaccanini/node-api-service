# nodeAPIService

A simple RESTful API building with Node to expose a CRUD operations, as a GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 

In this solution weâ€™ll be looking at creating a RESTful API using Node and Express, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB instance. We will also be testing our API using a ASP.NET MVC 5 + AngularJS project.

Server-Side
- MongoDB
- Node
- Node Modules (Mongoose, Path, Express, Http, Body Parser)

Client-Side
- ASP.NET MVC5
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap
